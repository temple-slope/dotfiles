# API Limits (Must Consider Before Calling)

These limits must be considered when calling APIs to avoid request failures due to insufficient quota or rate limiting.

## Rate Limits

Rate limit rule: Maximum n calls within 30 seconds; the interval between the 1st and (n+1)th call must exceed 30 seconds.

| API | Rate Limit |
|-----|------------|
| `place_order` | 15/30s |
| `modify_order` | 20/30s |
| `order_list_query` | 10/30s |

**Batch Operation Note**: When making loop calls to rate-limited APIs (e.g., batch orders, batch historical Candlestick requests), you must add appropriate `time.sleep()` intervals in the loop to avoid triggering rate limits.

## Subscription Quota Limits

- Each stock subscribed to one type consumes 1 subscription quota; unsubscribing releases the quota
- Different SubTypes for the same stock are counted separately
- Must wait at least 1 minute after subscribing before unsubscribing
- After unsubscribing, all connections must unsubscribe from the same stock for the quota to be released
- Closing a connection less than 1 minute after subscribing will not release the subscription quota; it will auto-unsubscribe after 1 minute
- Use `query_subscription.py` to check used quota
- HK market requires LV1 or above permissions to subscribe
- US pre-market/after-hours requires `--extended-time`

## Historical Candlestick Quota Limits

- Within the last 30 days, each unique stock's historical Candlestick request consumes 1 quota
- Repeated requests for the same stock within 30 days do not consume additional quota
- Different Candlestick periods for the same stock only consume 1 quota
- **Before calling `request_history_kline`**, check remaining quota via `get_history_kl_quota(get_detail=True)`
- **When batch-fetching Candlesticks for multiple stocks**, check quota first and confirm remaining quota >= number of stocks to request before executing

## Quota Tiers

Subscription quota and historical Candlestick quota are tiered based on user assets and trading activity:

| User Type | Subscription Quota | Historical Candlestick Quota |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Account holder | 100 | 100 |
| Total assets >= 10K HKD | 300 | 300 |
| Total assets >= 500K HKD / Monthly trades > 200 / Monthly volume > 2M HKD (any one) | 1000 | 1000 |
| Total assets >= 5M HKD / Monthly trades > 2000 / Monthly volume > 20M HKD (any one) | 2000 | 2000 |

## Other Limits

| API | Limit |
|-----|-------|
| `get_market_snapshot` | Max 400 stocks per call |
| `get_order_book` | num max 10 |
| `get_rt_ticker` | num max 1000 |
| `get_cur_kline` | num max 1000 |
| `request_history_kline` | max_count max 1000 per call, use page_req_key for pagination |
| `get_stock_filter` | Max 200 results per call |
